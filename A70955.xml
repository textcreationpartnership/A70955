            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was taken from the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the year 1471. The ſoil is very fertile, affording all ſorts of Graine, Wine, and Oyle, as likewiſe Fleſh and Fowl; the Sea abounding with Fiſh.

When I was there in the year 1676. a Renegado was taken; He was a Greek born on the Iſland of <hi>Candy;</hi> &amp; turned Turk when the <hi>Vizier</hi> was at the Siege of <hi>Candy;</hi> afterwards he marryed at <hi>Scio,</hi> and lived very well; but upon ſome diſcontent he made his eſcape from <hi>Scio,</hi> and got to the Privateers of <hi>Malta,</hi> with whom he lived ſome years; &amp; landing on this Iſland, he with ſome others were ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and taken. His companions were condemned to the Gallys, but his ſentence was to be ſhott away, out of one of theſe great Gunns, which was accordingly effected.</p>
            <p>None but <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> live within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, where are very ſpacious houſes, and four which deſerve the name of <hi>Seraglios;</hi> One for the Baſha, at the right hand coming into the Caſtle from the Port; One for his Lievetenant or Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahja; a Third belonging to <hi>Ibrahim Aga</hi>'s Son (of whoſe Father we will ſpeak anon;) and the Fourth, to <hi>Muzlee Aga;</hi> Which are very richly ſet out with carved work and painting. At the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99880:4"/>latter I was very often entertained upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account. <hi>Muzlee Aga</hi> was taken a Slave in the year 1660, &amp; ſold at <hi>Legorne,</hi> where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſeveral years, and ſerved as a Porter about the Streets, paying his Maſter dayly what he got. He won the favour of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>William Mico</hi> (an Engliſh Merchant) who beſides his due, would often give him ſome ſmall matter, &amp; recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to others of his friends. <hi>Muzlee Aga</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Mico,</hi> imparts the circumſtances of his preſent condition to him, telling him he had good freinds, who would redeem him, and withall deſired M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mico</hi> to uſe his intereſt with his Patron, to be moderate in exacting his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, giving him a Letter, to be ſent to his friends at <hi>Negro Ponte,</hi> but without his Patron's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mico</hi> purſuant to his humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, did obtaine his ranſom on eaſy terms. Soon after orders came from <hi>Muzlee Aga</hi>'s freinds to buy his ranſom for five hundred pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Eight, which they would pay at <hi>Smyrna.</hi> Which was ſhort by two hundred of what was agreed for. Upon <hi>Muzlee Aga</hi>'s obligation M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Mico</hi> frees him, and ſends him to <hi>Smyrna</hi> to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard Langly;</hi> in whoſe houſe he tarried, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the remainder of the mony was ſent him, which he paid, and went to his friends. I then lived at <hi>Smyrna</hi> with Mr. <hi>Langley;</hi> And now being at <hi>Negro Ponte</hi> ſitting in the Coffee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99880:5"/>houſe, one morning, I obſerved him to look ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often on me, and riſing from his place he came to me, asking me what Country man I was, from whence I came, and whether I was going. I told him that I was an Engliſh man, come from <hi>Patraſs,</hi> and was going to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> Then, ſays he, you are the Man I took you for, and I thank God, that I have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to requite the kindneſſes, that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from your Nation. He would often have me to eat with him. In the year 1679. I was here again, coming from <hi>Athens</hi> I was robb'd by ſome <hi>Albaneſes. Muzlee Aga</hi> gets me paſſage on a <hi>Lundra</hi> (built in form like a Galley, more for burthen, and ſayling, than rowing) for <hi>Scio,</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboard 6 henns, 10 oakes, (an oak is about two pound eight ounces Engliſh) of white Bisket, 10 oakes of Wine, a Jarr of Olives, and a Jarr of Pettmeſh, recommending me to the <hi>Reys</hi> (or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) ſaying, <hi>I recommend this man to you, when you ſee him, you ſee me, what you do to him, you do for me, and I will anſwer it, be it good or ill.</hi>

            <p>Notwithſtanding their fine houſes in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, the <hi>Baſha</hi> has a very large houſe to the NW<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of the Caſtle, near the Gally Haven. In the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle are two Moſques; the one was a Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Mark.</hi> There are ſeverall Wells, but moſt of the water which ſerves to drink is brought in with Jarrs. About a furlong from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99880:5"/>the Caſtle, is the New Town very well built (after the Turkiſh manner) with a large <hi>Bazare</hi> or Market-place. Here are two Moſques, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Greek Churches. The Chriſtians here, are thrice the Number of the Turks, and Jews. The Jeſuites have alſo a ſmall Chappel in their houſe; Their care is to look after the Slaves, when the Gallys are there. Between the Caſtle and the Town is their Burying place, ſet out with many fine peeces of Marble, moſt of which are brought from the ruins of <hi>Athens.</hi> The Harbour is very ſecure againſt any wind, it may be ſaid to be a Port for above two miles, the main land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near and the ground good ankor hold. It is ſecured from an Enemy by the Caſtle, which has above twenty good Gunns planted this way. Upon the whole Iſland, there is but one place more, which may be called a Town, which is <hi>Caſtel Roſſo,</hi> by the Turks called <hi>Kiſil Hiſar.</hi> It was formerly called <hi>Caristus,</hi> (as the Greeks ſtill call it) ſtanding in a deep Bay, at the SE<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of the Iſland. The Caſtle ſtands on a high and ſteep hill, above a mile from the Sea, having a large plain, which ſtretcheth towards the SW<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. But affords little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Mulberry trees, whereof there are ſtore. The Town is built ſtragling upon two Mountains Moſt of the houſes are very mean, being made of red earth, dryed in the Sun. The Caſtle is to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtanding very advantageouſly to defend it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99880:6"/>ſelf againſt an Enemy. The Bay is open to the South Winds. Veſſels which come from <hi>Canea, Malvaſia, Napoli, Athens,</hi> or other parts, that way, and bound for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> do uſually put in here to inquire for news of Privateers. For from the Mountains, to the North of the Caſtle, in a clear day may be ſeen the high Land of <hi>Scio;</hi> and no Veſſel can paſs the Streight of <hi>Andros,</hi> but what is ſeen from hence. Small Veſſels uſe to come here for ſhelter againſt the Privateers, but have been carryed away by them in the night; to prevent which one <hi>Ibrahim Aga,</hi> at his own charge, built a Fort of an Octagon figure with two Teer of Guns, 16 Guns in each Teer. After he had finiſhed it, an order came from the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to have him Strangled. He had ſome Private E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy who gave the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to underſtand, that he had ſome bad thoughts, in building this Fort. His Eſtate was all confiſcated; But through the interceſſion of great freinds it was moſt part recovered for the uſe of his Son, who lived at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro Ponte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of this Place, is a large Bay called <hi>Porto Buffolo,</hi> which is able to contain many thouſand ſhips. A Greek Prieſt told me that <hi>Xerxes</hi> had here above 1500 ſaile of ſhips, and other Veſſels of warr. Cloſe by the water ſide, to the Eaſtward, are a great many marble Pillars; All ſhips that come to lade <hi>Velania</hi> (i. e. dryed Acorns)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99880:6"/>carry ſome away. Two miles to the North of the Port are a great many ruins more, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral foundations of walls.</p>
            <p>On a Mountain more Northerly is a great wall, above three miles about, and cloſe by it is a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Cupa.</hi> The ruined place they told me was called <hi>Amatos.</hi> To the North are ſeveral good Ports, and there the Inhabitants live more ſecure than to the South. They reckon to be upon the whole Iſland not above 60000 ſoules, of which not above 10000 <hi>Turks,</hi> who moſt live under the command of the Caſtles at <hi>Negro Ponte,</hi> and <hi>Caſtel Roſſo.</hi> Here is abundance of ſilks made, moſt of which is carryed to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> towards payment of their tribute, and <hi>Decimos.</hi> The <hi>Grand Signor</hi>'s Revenue from this great Iſland, is about 100000 Dollars. As to the Tides motion at the Bridg, I will not trouble the Reader with the ſeveral opinions, that men have about it; only that it has been obſerved by ſeveral others, as well as my ſelf, that ſometimes it will paſs contrary at the one ſide to the other, and this commonly on a Southerly wind. The next Iſland we come to in rank to the Eaſt is</p>

            <head>ANDROS.</head>
            <p>This keeps its name, being called by the Turks <hi>Endros.</hi> The Inhabitants are all Greeks, having a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99880:7"/>good large Town to the NE<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. with no other walls, but thoſe of their houſes, which join together. At the end of the lanes are Gates, which every night are ſhut, to keep out the Privateers. In the Mountains are ſeveral ſmall Villages, which are built ſo convenient as they can ſee an Enemy, long before he comes; ſo they have time to hide themſelves, and the beſt of their goods, in places made by their Induſtry in the Rocks. Upon the whole Iſland there are not above 3000 Inhabitants, They have a great many Mulberry trees, and ſome years make above 10000 pound of Silk. They agree at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for about 10000 Dollars yearly, tho it ſtands them in above 12000: beſides what the Privateers ſteal from them. Corn and Wine are here very plentifull, but their main ſtock is raiſed from Silk, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. with the latter, and other proviſions they ſupply <hi>Tine.</hi> There are ſeveral good Harbours for ſmall Veſſels, but only one for ſhips, which is to the SE<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99880:7"/>they landed their Army ſeveral times. In the year 1658. the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> came to a Port to the N<hi rend="sup">h</hi>. called <hi>La Colebitre,</hi> when in the night he landed 6000 men, hoping to ſurprize them; But the vigilant Iſlanders ſoon fled from their habitations, and betook themſelves to the Caſtle, ſurrounding the hill, under the great Gunns. The <hi>Proveditore</hi> diſpatcht away a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucca</hi> to acquaint the Captain General at <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiero;</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> finding they could not take the Caſtle, deſtroyed the Country, burnt the houſes, and carryed away about 10 ſlaves. The Caſtle ſtands on a high rock on the top of the Mountain. It is much higher than any other part of the Iſland, ſo as it may be diſcerned at both ſides of the Iſland. Upon any occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, Fires were made upon the top of the Caſtle, which have been ſeen at the Iſland of <hi>Scio.</hi> The Inhabitants are moſt Greeks, but theſe the greateſt part are Roman Catholicks, who have <hi>here</hi> a Biſhop. His Palace is at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Campos,</hi> to the NW<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of the Caſtle, diſtant from it about 3 miles. There are above thirty Villages upon this Iſland, and above 20000 ſouls. Thoſe of the Greek Religion are to the Eaſtward end of the Iſland, having many pleaſant Villages; though ſeated among Rocks. <hi>Tine</hi> hath but one Port, which is ſecure for ſhipping. It lyes in the ſtrait of <hi>Andros,</hi> called <hi>Palermo.</hi> But the Road,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99880:8"/>where the ſhips uſually come to unload, is called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Niccolo,</hi> about 6 miles South from the Caſtle to the Eaſt is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Zuanni,</hi> a ſmall Port for Boats. To the North is another called <hi>La Cullebithra.</hi> This Iſland has ever been a great Eye-ſore to the <hi>Turks.</hi> In the late Warr of <hi>Candia,</hi> ſeveral Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines were mann'd out of this place; which did continually torment the <hi>Turks</hi> in all their Quarters. A famous Privateer, called <hi>Georgio Maria,</hi> was a terror to all the ſea-Towns about the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> He was of <hi>Corſica,</hi> of a good Family. He came into the ſervice of the <hi>Venetians</hi> with a ſmall <hi>Briganteen,</hi> called the <hi>Lepetto</hi> (or little Fox) his ſucceſs was ſo great, that he built at <hi>Bagnio</hi> a place for ſlaves made ſquare, to the Eaſt of the City on the hill, in which was an account of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 4000 that he had brought out of <hi>Turky</hi> into ſlavery, of which he gave the tenth to the Generall. From a ſmall Veſſel he came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſquadron of three ſhips and Eleven <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganteens.</hi> I will not give you an account at large of his ſeveral Victories, if I ſhould, it would ſwell my Narrative to too great a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. I will therefore only give you a Relation of his Death. In the year 1667 <hi>Georgio Maria</hi> had been very ſuccesful againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way whole Towns at a time, ſo as complaint was carryed from all parts to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where his name was in every ſea-faring-mans mouth.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99880:8"/>The Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> had particular orders to ſearch for him, and being at <hi>Scio,</hi> advice was brought him, that <hi>Georgio Maria</hi> with his little Armado was at the Iſlands in the Bay of <hi>Edremitt.</hi> The Perſon, who brought the news, had a Gratuity order'd him; and immediatly all things were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd for departure, but the <hi>Baſha</hi> only, and the man that brought the news did know for what place they were going. There was in Port at <hi>Scio</hi> 36 Gallys, and ſix ſhips of <hi>Tripoli.</hi> The Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> ſent orders to the ſhips, to be ready to ſayle with his Gallys. There being lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wind the <hi>Gallys</hi> towed the ſhips, till they were paſt the Iſland of <hi>Scio,</hi> and drawing neare the Iſland <hi>Metelino,</hi> with a ſmall gale, they ſayled cloſe by <hi>Molives.</hi> The Sentinells on the Iſlands made fires to give notice to <hi>Georgio Maria,</hi> and ſoon came themſelves with the news, that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> fleet was coming towards thoſe Iſlands. <hi>Georgio Maria</hi> eaſily believed it, and in a little time provided himſelf, notwithſtanding he was before getting ready to carine his ſhip. With the help of his <hi>Briganteens</hi> he gets his ſhips out to the North of the Iſlands, ordering the <hi>Briganteens</hi> to ſhift for themſelves; taking his laſt farewell of them. The Fight was very ſharp above 6 hours. <hi>Georgio Maria</hi> was kill'd, and his body thrown over board, (as he had deſired his friends to do) that it might not come into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99880:9"/>his ſhip was taken, another was ſunk, and the third made its eſcape into the Bay of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Tine.</hi> Of the Turks were killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above two thouſand, of which in the <hi>Tripoly</hi> ſhips above 300. In the ſhip where <hi>Georgio Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was, (of 200 men) not above 20 were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and thoſe moſt of them wounded. After this Victory the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> went to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> towing up the ſhip in great Triumph at his Gallys Stern, as he paſt the <hi>Serraglio</hi> point. No man ſince <hi>Scanderbeigh</hi> has been ſo great a plague to the <hi>Turks.</hi> His loſs was generally lamented by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but eſpecially by thoſe of this Iſland, whom he very much inriched. He was made a Knight of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Mark,</hi> for the good ſervice he had done the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Tine</hi> are better to paſs than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Iſlanders, paying only their tenths to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> They make great quantitys of Silk and Wine, but have not corn nor wood to ſubſiſt a month, being ſupplyed from other Iſlands, and parts of the Maine, cloſe by them. Since the peace between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> they have conſented to pay to the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> a preſent of five hundred Dollars yearly, which was anciently a cuſtom. Here is a Noble <hi>Venetian</hi> Governour, who hath the title of <hi>Proveditore,</hi> and judges in all civil matters; but Appeals are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of for any buſineſs that exceeds a hundred
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99880:9"/>Ducats, and then the ſuit may be removed to <hi>Venice:</hi> All criminal cauſes are judged by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor,</hi> who reſides at <hi>Suda,</hi> an Iſland in a Bay near <hi>Candia.</hi> In the year 1670 I came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Negro Ponte,</hi> Ill<hi rend="sup">mo</hi>. <hi>Signior Dominico Diedo</hi> was <hi>Proveditore,</hi> who lived in very great ſtate. I had the honour to dine with him ſeveral times, being introduced by <hi>Padre Emanuel</hi> a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, and Captain <hi>Beneditto Neſte</hi> a <hi>Legorneſs.</hi> The former I had often ſeen at the Jeſuites Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadors houſe at <hi>Galatta</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> He was here in great Eſteem, being a learned <hi>Scholar,</hi> a great <hi>Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and an Experienced <hi>Phyſician;</hi> he had an eminent intereſt, as well in <hi>Turky,</hi> as in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom:</hi> having an Univerſal correſpondence in moſt places of <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> He would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine all Strangers of what Nation, or Religion ſoever, and gave me ſo good an account, of my own Country, as few of my own Countrymen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad have been able to give me the like. He never would diſcourſe of Religion, nor give his opinion to any, but thoſe who deſired it. The <hi>Proveditore</hi> has his Palace in the Caſtle, very pleaſantly ſeated; above it is the Rock and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Helens,</hi> which commands the lower Caſtle. To this Fort you go up by ſteps cut out of the Rock. There is no water but what is in ciſterns, or brought in upon Aſſes backs. Here
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99880:10"/>is a Bay to the W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Niccolo</hi> called <hi>La Sciogna,</hi> where are the Foundations of a very large Temple which was dedicated to <hi>Neptune.</hi>

            <p>Keeps its name, lying to the SE<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of <hi>Tine,</hi> about 12 miles diſtant, being near 40 miles about. It has but one Town bearing the name of the Iſland, which is at the NW<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. part, without any Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It is a large Town, having many <hi>Greek Churches,</hi> and one <hi>Latine Church,</hi> which ſerves when any Privateers come; for here are very few other than of the <hi>Greek Religion.</hi> Moſt of the Inhabitants are Privateers, who ſerve with the <hi>Legorneſes</hi> and <hi>Malteſes,</hi> leaving their women to their own diſcretion, and the Civility of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The chief product of the Iſlands is Wine, Corne, and Fruit. The <hi>Venetians</hi> uſually in time of peace come with their ſhips, and provide themſelves with wine. But the greateſt of their profit is from Privateers. The women are here very Beautiful, and want not for husbands. Thoſe, who go to ſea, are the younger ſort of their men, and when they have well ſtock't themſelves with gaine, come and ſpend it here. This Iſland is very near the Road from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſeldom is it free from Privateers. Great complaint has been made to the Port, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99880:10"/>every year the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> did threaten them; but the crafty old men (whom they call their <hi>Vec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiardi</hi>) uſe to meet the <hi>Baſha</hi> at <hi>Scio,</hi> in a ſad condition, complayning that they muſt leave the Iſland in caſe the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> did not allow them a Caſtle and Garriſon; pretending they could not command in their own houſes, while the Privateers were there: and repreſenting their condition in a moſt deplorable manner, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years they prevented the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> from coming to Viſit them, injoying their time in the beſt manner they could. In the year 1680 in the month of <hi>September,</hi> one <hi>Anzolo Maria,</hi> takes a <hi>Saik,</hi> which came from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> very richly loaden, which <hi>Saik</hi> he carrys to <hi>Micone,</hi> where he divided the prize amongſt his Companions, letting the <hi>Reys</hi> (or Maſter who was a Greek of <hi>Metelino</hi>) have his freedom to depart. The <hi>Reys</hi> pretended he would go for <hi>Venice,</hi> and to have paſſage thither, he would paſs to <hi>Tine,</hi> telling <hi>Anzolo Maria</hi> that he had no mony to defray his expence, and ſo deſired his charity. <hi>Anzolo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> gave him 10 Dollars, with which he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Tine,</hi> where he found a Boat ready to ſaile for <hi>Scio.</hi> Upon which he imbarques, and arrived there the next morning. Here he findes the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> ready to go for <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> to him he runs, giving him an account of the loſs he had ſuſtained from <hi>Anzolo Maria,</hi> whom he left
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99880:11"/>but two days before at <hi>Micone.</hi> No ſooner had the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> notice, but immediatly he gives the ſigne for departure. About midnight he ſailes from <hi>Scio,</hi> and the next day about noon came before <hi>Micone.</hi> The weather being rainy and thick, he was not ſeen by the <hi>Miconiotes,</hi> till he was almoſt in the Haven; But comes into the Harbour to the Southward of the Town, and immediatly landed 2000 <hi>Levents</hi> (Soldiers of the Gallies) to take poſſeſſion of all the Boates and other Veſſels, that were in the Harbour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Town. While <hi>Anzolo Maria</hi> was at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with his friends, news was brought him, that the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> was arrived at the back ſide of the Town, and had landed his <hi>Levents;</hi> upon which he immediatly went to a Point of land where was a ſmall fiſher boat, in which he and another man put to Sea, and notwithſtanding the Seas run very high, they paſſed over to <hi>Delos,</hi> in ſight of all the Gallys; the wind being ſo ſtrong as none of the Gallys could get out to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him, and moſt thought it impoſſible he could eſcape drowning.</p>
            <p>We leave him to his Fate, and come back to <hi>Micone,</hi> where the Scene is ſtrangely alter'd ſince morning, when all had their beſt attir's on, ſinging and dancing in every houſe. Now they had all unſtript themſelves, ſeeking places to hide their fine clothes, and husbands, whoſe ſinging
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99880:11"/>was turned into weeping and wailing. The <hi>Vec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiardi</hi> were ſent for, to whom the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> ſaid, <hi>Bring me Anzolo Maria immediatly, or I will hang you up at the Gally-yard.</hi> The Captain <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi>'s name was <hi>Kaplan Baſha,</hi> he was a man of great Reſolution, and ſubject to Paſlion. The <hi>Vecchiardi</hi> ſummon'd all the inhabitants, ordering the Prieſts to excommunicate all thoſe who ſhould conceal <hi>Anzolo Maria,</hi> or any of his companions, and not bring them out before the Captain <hi>Baſha.</hi> Ten of his intimate companions were found, and carryed aboard the <hi>Baſha</hi>'s Gallys; None of theſe knew of <hi>Anzolo Maria</hi>'s eſcape, nor did va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue their lives, to ſave his. Moſt of them were <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Sclavonians;</hi> the <hi>Baſha</hi> ordered them to be put in Irons till next morning, and that night every houſe in the town was ſearched, not a Cheſt but what was emptied and the Vaults in the Churches open'd to look for Privateers, ſo as that night above two hundred men were clapt into Irons. The wife of <hi>Anzolo Maria,</hi> and her Mother, were put into the Cuſtody of the <hi>Kiahja</hi> that night. Next morning the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> ſent again for the <hi>Vecchiardi,</hi> threatning to hang them, if they did not produce <hi>Anzolo Maria. They told him that he was certainly got out of the Iſland in a ſmall Boat, and without queſtion muſt have periſhed in the Sea.</hi> Then he ordered the 10 men, which were Comrades of <hi>Anzolo Maria,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:99880:12"/>to be brought before him. To the firſt he ſaid; <hi>Confeſs if you know where your Captain is, and you ſhall have your liberty.</hi> To which he boldly anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered; <hi>That he knew not, and if he did know, he would ſooner looſe his life, than diſcover him.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſays the <hi>Baſha, if you do not diſcover to me where he is, immediatly your head ſhall be ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from your body.</hi> He anſwered boldly, <hi>I am in your power, you may do what you pleaſe with me, and if I might have my choice, I had rather dye than be your Slave.</hi> He was immediatly beheaded in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Companions, thereby to terrifie them. A ſecond came, to whom the <hi>Baſha</hi> offer'd as to the firſt, but he was in the ſame tune with his companion. Then ſayes the <hi>Baſha, upon my word</hi> (taking his beard in his hand) <hi>if any one of you diſcover to me where</hi> Anzolo Maria <hi>is, you ſhall have your libertys, and mony to carry you out of the Country;</hi> But they all were of the firſt mans reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. At firſt the <hi>Baſha</hi> reſolved to take away all their lives, but upon more mature conſideration, he only condemned them to the Gallys. After theſe was brought a Chirurgion who had often cured <hi>Anzolo Maria</hi> of his wounds, he was laid down and thraſh't on the Feet with ſmall ſticks 100 blows; then was brought to the <hi>Baſha,</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Executioner to be preſent, threatning him to have his head taken off, if he did not find out <hi>Anzolo Maria.</hi> The Chirurgion told him he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99880:12"/>had not ſeen him, in above three days, he was then laid down again, and received two hundred ſtripes on the Buttocks, two hundred on the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and being in a Swoon, he was carred away. Thus was he uſed for three days. All the fleſh of his feet came off, his belly was much bliſter'd, and his Buttocks were like unto <hi>Carbonados.</hi> I ſaw him before he was perfectly cured, and from his mouth, and ſeveral of the <hi>Vecchiardi,</hi> I had this account. The wife of <hi>Anzolo Maria,</hi> and her Mother, to make them confeſs, were ſerved as follows. They were ſtript and put into two pair of Greek breeches, which were drawn up above their knees, the upper part tyed above their breaſts, and their hands tied up to a Poſt. Into each pair of breeches, was put a young Kittling, which were beaten with ſmall ſticks, which made them leap up and down about the Breeches, and exercize their claws upon the womens bodys. Thrice were they thus ſerved. For a week did the <hi>Baſha</hi> continue in this Iſland, and carryed away with him what riches he could find, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending they belonged to <hi>Anzolo Maria</hi>) with 100 young men that had been with the Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers. He threatned the <hi>Vecchiardi,</hi> that if he heard, that they received <hi>Anzolo Maria,</hi> or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Privateers to come upon the Iſland, he would hang every one of them, and make their

            <p>Are good Iſlands, but they are continually plagued with the Privateers; ſo as all that their land doth produce, will but ſerve to pay their taxes; if any can be ſaid to have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, it is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Erino,</hi> here being ſeveral Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who have ſome power amongſt the <hi>Malte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and drive a ſmart trade; buying up prize goods: they carry them, and ſell them at <hi>Scala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nova,</hi> and other places in <hi>Aſia,</hi> bringing for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns cotton, which is here wrought into Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys, and which are the beſt in all the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> great quantitys goe yearly to <hi>Candia, Zante,</hi> and other places. Theſe Merchants alſo agree at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the tribute of the whole Iſland. Moſt ſtrangers are given to underſtand, the whole Iſland is enchaunted; ſuch terrifying noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſomtimes heard, and the ſhips moorings to the ſhoare being often loſed. A Dutch ſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſervice came to anchor in the Bay, making a harſor faſt to one of the Rocks, and having underſtood how other Veſſels were uſed to be ſerved, the Maſter had two men a ſhoar to watch leaſt any ſhould cut his harſor.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99880:20"/>In the night there came a Catt to the water ſide, one of the <hi>Dutch-men</hi> flings a ſtone at the Catt. hit it, and imagined that it was dead. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly came down certain over-grown Catts, and ſo plagued the Dutch-men, that they called to their ſhip for help, upon which the Boat came a ſhoar, to carry the man aboard; but before they could come, one of the men was almoſt dead. Many ſuch things the <hi>Venetian</hi> marriners give an account of, having had the Cables very often cut cloſe to the ſhip. Which yet may be done in the night by a man ſwimming from the ſhoar. This Iſland has ſuffered very much by Earthquakes, a great part being ſwallowed up. One part of it was blown up into the air, which deſtroyed a whole Town with the Inhabitants.</p>

The land is not very high, only to the South are two Mountains, which to thoſe who come from <hi>Ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> ſeem like the tops of two Sugar loaves. It has a very faire Harbour, large, and ſecure againſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99880:20"/>all winds. Here Privateers do uſually come to make up their Fleets, and it is moſt commonly their Rendezvous, at their firſt coming into the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> There is but one Town, which ſtands in a very fine plaine, being very well built with good ſtone. The <hi>Capuchins</hi> have a Church, and Convent; The Privateers continually bring them ſome preſents, and moſt of the Iſlanders give them a great deal of Reſpect. The Greeks have ſeveral Monaſteries, one of which ſtands on a Mountain to the South. From whence in a clear day the Iſland of <hi>Candia</hi> may be diſcern'd. The Privateers had made this place their chief Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous for ſeveral years, to almoſt the ruine of the Iſland; but of late have not ſo much frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. The women are equal in beauty with any in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and pretend to exceed others in breeding; moſt of them ſpeaking <hi>Italian.</hi> The men are induſtrious, taking great pains to work their ground, it being worſer ſoil here than in any of the Iſlands, occaſioned from the Sulphurous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it.

            <p>Which lyes in length N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. and S<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. having ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſland to the Eaſt called <hi>Polina,</hi> tho moſt known by the name of <hi>Iſola Bruciata,</hi> or <hi>burnt Iſland,</hi> between theſe Iſlands is a very good road for ſhips, and Gallys. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Armada did much frequent this place, it lying ſo convenient that they might go to Sea with any wind, in caſe an Enemy ſhould come to attacque them; for they have a cuſtom never to be in any Haven, or Port where they may be penn'd in; unleſs it be under ſome of their Caſtles, or in ſome of their own Iſlands. On both theſe Iſlands there is a continual watch (when the Armada is there) which make ſigns with ſmoak for every ſaile which they ſee; the ſhips which come from <hi>Turky,</hi> they will examine them. In the year 1664 I was a paſſenger aboard the little <hi>Hunter, Roger Hutſon</hi> of <hi>Plymouth</hi> Maſter, bound from <hi>Smirna</hi> to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorne.</hi> We being off of the Iſland of <hi>Angentiero,</hi> a Felucca came to informe themſelves of News from <hi>Turky,</hi> we acquainted them of what we knew and departed. But the wind changed Weſterly, ſo our Maſter put back and he came to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99880:21"/>anchor at the North of <hi>Millo</hi> at a place called <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Polumbo,</hi> about 4 miles from the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet. So ſoon as we came to anchor, a boat came to command us to come to the General. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was a ſtranger to theſe Seas, and did not care to venture out of his ſhip, but at laſt I perſwaded him, and we went in our own Boat with two men. When we came to the Gally, the General order'd the Maſter and me to come into the Gally, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us at a diſtance, till by our Paſs-Port (or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tento</hi>) he ſaw the places, from whence we came, were free from contagious diſeaſes; then order'd us to be carryed to the Secretary, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what we had heard at <hi>Smirna</hi> concerning the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces. When we had done there, we deſired leave to fill ſome barrells of water, and get ſome other proviſion that we wanted. A man was order'd to go with us, to ſee that we paid no more than was the price; which was a great favour. When we returned, the General deſired the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that he would not ſaile without his Letters; which he promiſed ſhould be ready next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noon; the Maſter aſſured him he would ſtay; ſo we returned to our ſhip. About break of day the wind being fair at E<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. and a freſh gale, our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was very impatient to be going, ſeeing alſo a ſhip coming from the Eaſtward. All the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I could uſe would not prevaile with him; but reſolved he was to go, ordering his men to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99880:22"/>bring Cable to Capſtern, and heave. I told him what might be the ill conſequence of breaking his promiſe with a General, and that he would ſoon ſend after us; but he depended upon the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Veſſel, and queſtion'd not but ſoon to be out of their reach. All things were in readineſs, our anchor up, and we ſet ſaile. Soon did the wind abate, &amp; the Sentinells giving notice to the General that our ſhip had looſed ſaile, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two Gallys were diſpatcht after us, they came ſoon up to us, and firing a Gun, the ſhot paſt betwixt our Maſt. They commanded the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to come with his Boat to the General, bidding us drop anchor. To ſee in what a condition the Maſter was in, would have gain'd compaſſion in any one; he could not ſpeak a word of <hi>Italian,</hi> (to diſcourſe with) ſo begged of me to go with him. Indeed I did not deſire to be ſeen in the buſineſs, not knowing what might befall us; but go I did. They towed our boat at a Gally Stern and we ſoon came to the Generals Gally. By the way we reſolved on an Excuſe, after rowling a great many, I propoſed to the Maſter that our ſafeſt way was to acquaint the General, that our deſign was not to go to Sea; but that ſeeing a ſhip com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Eaſtward we did not know what ſhe might be; And we having Warr with <hi>Algier</hi> we were fearful, ſo weiged anchor to make a trip, and get under the Generals Stern. This thought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99880:22"/>of mine pleaſed the Maſter, and we concluded to anſwer in this note, when we ſhould be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. When we came to the Generals Gally, we were order'd to come up; the General asked which was the Maſter; I ſhewed him the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he order'd him to be put in chains at the Prow of the Gally, being in a very great paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſaid that he would make an Example of him, and give an account of his baſe action to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul at <hi>Venice.</hi> I let him breath out ſome of his paſſion, then ſpoke to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagno di Standardo,</hi> deſiring him to acquaint the General with the true manner of our intent, which he did. Upon which the General calls for me, bidding me ſpeak the truth. I told him our deſign was not to ſaile without his Excellencies Letters, but that we purpoſed to come with our ſhip under his Protection, whereupon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter was brought off again, and we were well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained till the General's Letters were finiſh't, and next day the wind prov'd very fair, we ſet ſaile. At my coming to <hi>Legorne</hi> the Maſter gives an account of this to his Merchant, who order'd him to preſent me with my Paſſage. This I hint, that all who travel by Sea or Land may learn to be cautious, and not ſlight Governors. The Iſland of <hi>Argentiero</hi> hath but one ſmall Town, whoſe Inhabitants are moſt Privateers.

Being ſent in this manner to this Iſland, the Inhabitants enquired who ſhe was, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told that ſhe was a Princeſs, that came to bath in the waters for her healths ſake, her dreſs pleaſed the common people, and now it continues their habit in moſt of the Iſlands, only their heads are better dreſt.

In the Summer time every evening the marine is full with all ſorts of people with muſick, ſinging, and dancing, and none offer to moleſt them. At their Feſtivals, they are very open in their Worſhip. The chief City has the name of the Iſland, being very well built after the manner of the <hi>Genoueſe.</hi> It is above two miles in Circumference. To the North ſtands a very ſtrong Caſtle, and both are ſeated to the Eaſtward cloſe to the Sea ſide.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99880:31"/>They are both now gon to ruine, and the Harbour is dangerous in Stormy weather.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99880:32"/>ſeveral times in the garden, and commended their way of living. Before the Vizier came, order was given by the Elders to forbid the womens walking the Streets as their cuſtom was, fearing leaſt ſome ſouldiers ſhould abuſe them, and ſo occaſion a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. The Vizier having been two or three days in town, and not finding the divertiſement he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from what he had been told, he asked what was the reaſon, it was told him that fearing ſome diſturbance might be, orders were given to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the women to walk the ſtreets. The Vizier made anſwer; <hi>That ſeeing they had ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, they ſhould enjoy them while he was there, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he would recall the Liberty they had.</hi> Next morning the ſtreets were full with all ſorts, and in the Evening by the Sea-ſide ſinging and danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt part of the nights. The <hi>Turks</hi> hold the <hi>Sciotes</hi> for a ſoft ſort of People calling them, <hi>Praſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinos</hi> which ſignifies <hi>green:</hi> A <hi>Baſha</hi> ſaying, <hi>it was as impoſſible to ſee a wiſe Sciote, as to ſee a green horſe.</hi> All the time that the Vizier was here, there wàs not the leaſt diſorder amongſt the Officers, but all were in <hi>dovere;</hi> and notwithſtanding here were upwards of fifty thouſand ſtrangers in town and in the Fleet, the price of proviſion was not advanced. The Town lyes about 12 miles from the <hi>Aſian</hi> ſhore almoſt oppoſite to a very ſtrong Caſtle, called <hi>Chiſme;</hi> From whence they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with moſt of their Proviſion; <hi>Scio</hi> not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99880:32"/>ſufficient for the Inhabitants, and thoſe paſſengers which are continually here. All Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> bound for the South uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call in here, both going and coming. There are above 30 Villages upon the Iſland, which are well inhabited moſt by <hi>Greeks;</hi> thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Maſtick Villages, to the South-ward, have their hair long. The time for gathering the Maſtick, is in <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September.</hi> The Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer goes out to the Villages, where they receive him with muſick, and feaſting. What Maſtick is gathered, it is all delivered to the Cuſtomer, for the Grand Signiors uſe, and he ſoon diſpatches it up to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to ſerve in the <hi>Serraglio,</hi> for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral uſes, What remains of the Grand Signiors ſtore, the Cuſtomer ſells to merchants. It is very dangerous for the Inhabitants, to keep any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick by them. In <hi>Turky</hi> they uſe it to chew and ſome mixe it in their bread. The <hi>Turks</hi> call it <hi>Sackes,</hi> and the Iſland has the ſame name. The <hi>Italians</hi> call it <hi>Maſtice,</hi> and <hi>Maſticare</hi> is to chew. When any company of women meet in <hi>Turky,</hi> ſome Maſtick is brought them on a ſerver, and each taking a little, they are chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſpitting moſt of the time. It is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical to ſee the old women roale it about their gumms; the effects which they finde by it are, that it carrys away the flegme, cleanſes and prevents the aking of the teeth; and cauſes a ſweet breath.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99880:33"/>Here is a continual watch kept round the Iſland; when they ſee any ſhips or other Veſſels, in the day time they make a ſmoak, and in the night ſhew lights; the laſt Tower ſends a man to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Cuſtomer, what Veſſels are on the Coaſt. If any paſſengers land in any part of the Iſland, the Sentinells accompany them to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomer, who inquires whence they came, and what buſineſs they have there; this is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſpies. Betwixt this Iſland and the main are ſeveral ſmall Iſlands called <hi>Spalmadori,</hi> which are much frequented with Privateers as thoſe before <hi>Metelino;</hi> they lye about 12 miles to the North from the City. In the year 1666 a <hi>Malta</hi> ſhip Commanded by the <hi>Chevalier Tincourt</hi> was at anchor between thoſe Iſlands, a fiſher man paſſing by ſees the ſhip; and coming to <hi>Scio</hi> finds the Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> with about 40 Gallys. And going immediatly to him asked for <hi>Muſtalook</hi> (a gift upon good tydings) for he had news to tell him. The <hi>Baſha</hi> hearing the news order'd the boat-man to have 10 dollars, and put to Sea, it being very calm. The Sentinells from the Hills came down, and acquainted Monſieur <hi>Tincourt,</hi> that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet was rowing toward the Iſlands, ſo he with his boats towed the ſhip out to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, before the Gallys came up to him, and had time to provide himſelf to receive them. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Fight was maintain'd for ſeveral hours,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99880:33"/>and not a breath of wind ſtirring; ſo as the ſhip lay to their mercy, and was boarded by them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, but were forc't off again leaving many men dead behind them. In the afternoon a freſh gale of wind began, at which thoſe in the ſhip took courage, and Forc't the <hi>Baſha</hi> to retire under the Guns of the Caſtles of <hi>Scio;</hi> Firing ſeveral broad ſides into the Town. The Captain <hi>Baſha</hi> ſent to the <hi>Capucins</hi> to have them to go off in a Boat, and perſwade the Captain to forbear firing into the Town. The <hi>Capucins</hi> went aboard, carrying ſome freſh proviſion as a preſent, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Monſieur Tincourt</hi> to forbear, for that moſt da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was to the poor Chriſtians. So he retir'd, and went to <hi>Micone</hi> to repair his ſhip. He was a <hi>French</hi> man born, not above 24 years of age; he built and fitted out the ſhip at his own charge, ſtiling himſelf the <hi>Champion of Chriſt.</hi> His Father or Uncle dyed in ſight againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> while he was but a child, to revenge whoſe blood, he took this reſolution; not above two months after, his ſhip was caſt away on the Iſland of <hi>Scyros,</hi> where he periſhed; and of two hundred and fifty men not above 5 eſcaped, which cauſed a great grief to all who had heard of his Valour. He had not been in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> above two months, before he Fought with the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> fleet; and intended to have paſt the <hi>Dardanelli</hi> (as a merchant ſhip) ſo to do what miſchief he could,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99880:34"/>to the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by firing againſt it and then to make his eſcape out of the Caſtles or periſh in the Action. I lived in <hi>Smyrna</hi> when this fight was, and had the particular relation from one of the <hi>Capucines.</hi> The profit which the <hi>Turks</hi> receive from <hi>Scio,</hi> is double what any other Iſland in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> payes; Nor are there any ſubjects in the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions, (of <hi>Greeks</hi>) that are richer. Their Habit is different from all other Iſlanders. The women have their Coats to their ancles, their bodys ſhort and thick waſted, their head dreſs with Linnen cloſe to their ears, raiſed up behind, (not unlike the Doge of <hi>Venice</hi> his Cornet) in which their hair is laid. They eſteem great Leggs, and little Feet, ſome to be in the faſhion will have 4 or more pair of ſtirrop Stockens. Before their breaſts hangs a bibb which reaches a little below their waſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it they have their hands cover'd when they are abroad; when they dance a round dance they hold a pocket handkercheif in their hands, that they may not have their hands touch't. They have ear-rings, neck-laces, and braceletts of gold. The men wear ſtrait body'd Jackets, with 4 broad skirts below the waſt, ſtrait kneed bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to button, or tye at the knees, ſhoes and ſtockens moſt according to the <hi>Genoueſes;</hi> they have a broad lappet of Linnen faſtned to the neck-band of their ſhirts, which hangs down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99880:34"/>over their backs. Their hair is cut ſhort to their Ears, and generally they wear little red capps or broad brim'd hatts. But their <hi>Vecchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardi</hi> do wear long looſe Garments over their Jackets and breeches.</p>

But the Grand Signors revenues muſt be yearly paid, which amounts to above 30000 dollars, that is, pole mony, and tenths, which is eaſy to what was pretended. Here are delicate fruits of all ſorts, peaches the largeſt I ever ſaw, alſo the Winter grapes in very large bunches, ſome weighing 10 pounds.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99880:38"/>runs a ridg of rocks from the great Iſland almoſt halfe a mile into the Sea, being about 16 Foot under water. Upon theſe Rocks the ſhip <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> ſtuck faſt, having aboard her the R<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> a true relation of which follows. In the year 1660 his Lordſhip imbarqued on the <hi>Plymouth,</hi> on an Embaſſy from His Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> to the Grand <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> and about the end of <hi>December</hi> arrived at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where his Lordſhip tarryed till <hi>January</hi> the 6. When he imbarqued again for his Voyage to <hi>Canſtantinople.</hi> So ſoon as his Lordſhip was aboard they ſet ſaile, with the wind at Eaſt, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Caſtle, which is about three Leagues from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> it fell calme; then they came to anchor, and tarryed all night, having in their company the ſhip Smyrna-Factor, and a Ketch, the latter waited upon the man of Warr. Next morning being the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the wind at S E<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 'twas a fine gale, they weighed anchor, the weather promiſing them a ſpeedy paſſage, but the wind veering to the N E<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with a ſtrong gale, they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>Caraborun</hi> ſtanding for the Iſland of <hi>Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino;</hi> intending to ſpend the night under the Lee of that Iſland in ſmooth water, bringing their ſhip under a Maine-Courſe. All that night the wind increaſed every hour more and more, ſo that in the morning it was a moſt violent Storme, the Sea in a breach, the ſky very black and thick,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99880:38"/>and the Sun lowring and red, which were the undoubted Indications of its continuance. The Spray of the Sea was ſo forcibly carried by the wind over the ſhip, that the Maſts, yards and Decks were querned with the white ſalt. This extremity of weather made them think of ſome Port, to ſecure themſelves. The Iſland of <hi>Ipſara</hi> lying about 8 Leagues diſtant S by W<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telino,</hi> it was ſuppoſed by the Maſter a ſafe place with this wind to ſpend the fury of the Storm in; ſo they put her before it, with fore-ſaile down, and main-ſaile in the brailes; but the wind ſoon blew away their fore-ſaile like paper, and in bringing another to the yard, it had the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be foule of the flook of the anchor, and ſoon became as unſerviceable as the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus deprived of their commanding ſailes, they looſed their ſprit-ſaile and ſet their maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Steering in between the greater and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Iſlands, the ſhip had ſwift way being ſhott within the Northermoſt point, and luffing too near the great Iſland, on a ſuddain ſhe ſtuck faſt on a Rock, which aſtoniſhed them with a ſtrange amazement; the poor ſhip knocked five ſeveral times to cleare her ſelf from a total Wrack and ruine. They all began to deſpaire of her, and with caſt up eyes and ſtretched out armes thought now of no other but their laſt and final Port. But in the midſt of this horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99880:39"/>and diſtreſs it pleaſed God, who was their beſt Pilot, to bring the ſhip off, and to all their appearances without the leaſt damage: an eſcape ſo wonderful and miraculous (on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>January</hi>) as it ought to be ever recorded to Admiration by all that were partakers in the danger, and an Anniverſary thankſgiving be made to God for his Providence over and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them. When they were in this diſtreſs, they fired a Gun to give warning to the <hi>Smyrna</hi>-Factor, and Ketch, who thereupon ſtood away for <hi>Milo.</hi> The ſtorme continued all that day, ſo that with two anchors down (the ſheat anchor being one) they had much ado to ſecure the ſhip faſt, the Storm continuing ſo very violent. The 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the wind abated, and the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> it veered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to the S W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, ſo they ſailed towards the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danelle,</hi> the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> they got to <hi>Tenedos</hi> about 8 in the morning, and about 3 in the afternoon, entred the old Caſtles. From the new Caſtles a boat came off, in which was a meſſenger to acquaint his Lordſhip, that the Vizier had ſent orders that free paſſage ſhould be granted his Lordſhip, and his attendance with the ſhip, without any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance or moleſtation. From the old Caſtles came off a Boat in which were ſome Janizaries &amp; Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>germen (or Inter preters) belonging to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Bendiſh,</hi> that brought letters to his Lordſhip. On the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> (it being 3 Months ſince his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99880:39"/>imbarqued in <hi>England</hi>) they came to anchor neare the 7 Towers, till ſuch time as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Tho. Bendiſh</hi> had notice: then weighed anchor, and ſtood for the Port. Some time before a <hi>Boſtangee,</hi> one belonging to the Grand Signiors Garden, came aboard, pretending to be ſent from the <hi>Boſtangee Baſha</hi> to know what ſhip it was of ſo great Equipage, and Burthen, alſo telling them that the Grand Signior was ſeated on the corner of the wall of the <hi>Serraglio.</hi> With a freſh gale of wind they had all their colours abroad, with all their Guns, and waſtclothes out.

               <hi>Tho. Bendiſh</hi> came aboard to congratulate his Lordſhips arrival, his Lordſhip the next day (being the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived aſhore, and indeed with that great ſtate and handſom Equipage, that no Ambaſſador from <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> ever paſſed in with more honour or wonder of the Multitude. Where we will leave his Lordſhip and come back with the ſhip which tarryed ſome time at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and in her return called in at <hi>Meſſina, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorne,</hi> and ſeveral Ports of <hi>Spain,</hi> having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone many ſtormes at Sea, and at laſt arrived in

            <p>THE <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> called by the <hi>Turks Bogaſs Hiſar,</hi> is the Southern-moſt ſtrait between <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> the two Capes or head lands are <hi>Cape Grego</hi> on the European, and <hi>Cape Janizary</hi> on the <hi>Aſian</hi> ſhore, which are about two miles one from the other, having two new Caſtles, which ſtand low and oppoſite to each other, and were built after the great fight betwixt the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> in the year 1656, cloſe under the old Caſtles, Theſe two Caſtles have no other name then the <hi>New Caſtles,</hi> and the Cape has the ſame name; although it be corrupted by our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who call it <hi>Cape Janizary,</hi> taking the word <hi>Yenni byſar</hi> (new Caſtles) for <hi>Janizary</hi> (a Soldier) as alſo going into <hi>Smyrna</hi> they call <hi>Cape Giobernole</hi> for <hi>Cara Borun.</hi> From the new Caſtles to the old is about 20 miles. Theſe latter are not a mile wide; formerly here were the Cities of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99880:41"/>
               <hi>Seſtos</hi> and <hi>Abidos,</hi> and theſe are by the <hi>Italians</hi> called the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> I believe from the ruins of a City formerly called <hi>Dardanum,</hi> not far diſtant. The Caſtles ſtand oppoſite to each other, having above 100 Guns in each, moſt of which lye level with the water, ſo as it is almoſt impoſſible any ſhip ſhould paſs upward, without leave. The Gunners there are expert Marksmen; I have ſeen tryall made of their ſkill. In the year 1670 the <hi>Captain Baſha</hi> was there, when an empty Butt was caſt into the Sea about a mile above the Caſtles which the Stream brought down, and it being come between them, in two ſhott it was ſunk. When the <hi>Baſha</hi> departed he was ſaluted with two ſhott, one paſt juſt at the Prow, the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Poop of his Gally, ſo near as the water ſpry'd into the Gally. Here is a continual tyde or current which runs downwards, to the South ſo ſtrong as a Gally can hardly with a full ſtroak gain way againſt it, nor was it ever known that the Stream did run upwards. In the year 1665 I was a paſſenger in the <hi>Sampſon</hi> (Captain <hi>Samuel Chamblet</hi> Commander) from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> the winds being contrary we lay at anchor without the new Caſtles from <hi>May</hi> till the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> for here in the Summer time the winds are moſt Northerly. Our chief Mate M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Frith,</hi> was a very great Artiſt, and often would make tryalls about the current which runs down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99880:41"/>he found that ſome times the water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upward about 3 fathom deep, when at the ſame time it run ſwift downwards above. This experiment he tryed ſeveral times, with one and the ſame effect. Paſt the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> the Iſland of <hi>Marmora</hi> ſhews it ſelf, being but ſmall; it has its name from the quantity of Marble which is there. Several Slaves are employ'd to cut it out, and ſome old Gallys tranſport it to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> for the building thoſe ſtately <hi>Moſques, Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> and Palaces wherein it now flouriſhes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gulph of <hi>Montania</hi> is the Iſland of <hi>Papa</hi> not inhabited. About 16 miles from <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> are 7 Iſlands which ſome call the Iſlands of <hi>Princepe,</hi> tho' one only hath that name which is the largeſt; to it the <hi>Grecian</hi> Emperors did uſe to baniſh their Sons, if guilty of any great fault, now only one is inhabited, called <hi>Chalcis</hi> which is to the N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. of <hi>Princepe,</hi> there being a ſmall Village and two Monaſterys in it. Being ſo near to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> I muſt give the Reader a ſhort view of it. The ſcituation for pleaſantneſs, and conveniencie, and the Port for largneſs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity may ſue for preeminence above all others. The River between <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Galata,</hi> is not broader then the Thames at London-bridge, but hath much deeper water, ſo that no bridg can be made over. The largeſt ſhips may have their heads aſhore, and 18 fathom water at
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99880:42"/>their ſtern. The Arſenal next to that at <hi>Venice</hi> is the beſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> The broadeſt ſtreet in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is not ſo broad as Lumbard ſtreet. Very few houſes (if any) are above three ſtories high, they are built moſt with timber. Their ſhops &amp; warehouſes are moſt by the water ſide, to which all people flock in the day time, which makes it ſeem to be ſo populous. The <hi>Grand Signor</hi>'s <hi>Serraglio</hi> is ſeated on the moſt Eaſt point of the City having a proſpect up into the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> 'tis ſurrounded with a high wall near two miles round, having upwards of 400 large Cypreſs trees regularly planted in it, with many fair Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes without the wall cloſe to the Sea ſide. The <hi>Turks</hi> call this City <hi>Stamboll,</hi> to ſignify, that it is abounding in all things; and indeed it is the beſt ſupplyed with Fleſh, Fiſh, Fowl, Fruit and Corn of any great City in <hi>Europe.</hi> Many having given a large account of it already, I will forbear enlarging thereon. In the year 1665 a <hi>Quaker</hi> who lived in <hi>Dover,</hi> was perſwaded to come to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to convert the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> thoſe who ſet him on the deſign, perſwading him, that he ſhould have the gift of Tongues: but he was diſappointed in that, and all other his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and without ſeeing the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> or <hi>Vizier,</hi> by the Right Honorable the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi>'s order, was ſhipt aboard the ſhip <hi>Sun,</hi> and ſent for <hi>Legorn.</hi> I have ſince ſeen

            <head>The preſent State of that famous Iſland and Kingdom of <hi>CANDIA.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> which in old time (and now by the <hi>Turks</hi>) is called <hi>Crete,</hi> hath followed the other parts of the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> and is now ſubjected to the Tyranny of the <hi>Turks,</hi> after a Warr for above 27 years. In which time the <hi>Venetians</hi> (tho' in comparriſon, as a flea in the beard of a Lyon, to the Ottoman Forces) did bravely, and with an unparallel'd Courage, defend the City of <hi>Candia</hi> to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. After a cloſe Siege for near 2 years continuance, the Vizier there in perſon, and with him the beſt of all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces, they were forced to ſurrender, yet upon the moſt honorable termes, that they themſelves could propoſe; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away with them not only their Cannon, and all other amunition, but alſo the bells, which were in the Steeples, and whatever elſe they thought worth the Labour. The Vizier was ſo over-joyed, that the City was ſurrender'd to him, that he appointed ſeveral of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> boats, to aſſiſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> if they ſhould have occaſion of their help in carrying their goods to the ſhips. He was ſo obſerving of his word in the Peace.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99880:46"/>that he cauſed two <hi>Janizarys</hi> to be put to death for attempting to force their way into the City. All <hi>Europe</hi> has heard of this great Seige, how many thouſand Bombs were caſt into the City; How many Mines, and Fornellos were blown up; and how many bold aſſaults the <hi>Turks</hi> made. They had at laſt workt themſelves ſo near the Walls that it was impoſſible for the beſieged to make uſe of any of their great Guns. For no ſooner could a man appear to level a Gun, but there was a ſhower of bullets and arrows, ſo that the <hi>Turks</hi> would often attempt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Walls, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> did counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, and when they met under ground, they fought moſt deſperately. The <hi>Venetians</hi> have an Engine which they call <hi>trombo di fuo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> it is as long as a half Pike, the Staff bigger: At the end are two Irons, about two Foot long, in the form of a fork; In which is faſtned a trunk made of Iron, (and ſome are of wood) in it are five charges, each firing ſeverally at a certain time, and carry ſeveral bullets to do execution as far as a Piſtol. They ſet fire to it at the fore part, and have a touch, to reach from one chamber to the other. Another Invention they had to fiſh up the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they attempted to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Walls. They had hooks made in the forme of a boats grapling, the points ſharp, faſtn'd to a rope and 4 or 5 foot of chain at the end;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99880:46"/>Theſe hooks they often caſt over the Walls, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſeldom failed to bring up a <hi>Turke,</hi> ſome faſtned by the clothes, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the body. I have heard ſome of the officers ſay, they have taken ſeveral in a night. For when the hook was faſtned, they gave them not time to unhook themſelves but had them ſoon over the Walls, and many a <hi>Turk</hi> have the common ſoldiers eaten. At the <hi>Greeks</hi> leaving <hi>Candia</hi> there happned a moſt ſad accident; a new ſhip called <hi>La Fregatta Galliera,</hi> or the Gally Frigot, was pitcht upon for tranſporting moſt of the Principal of the Gentry, and the greateſt part of the riches of the Citizens; there was alſo (beſides what were mounted) 50 great braſs Guns, the Paſſengers were between 250 and 300 beſides 200 Mariners and upward. Being between a little Iſland called <hi>Ovo,</hi> and the Port of <hi>Cerigo,</hi> the ſhip open'd, and not a man was ſaved. The reſt of the Fleet got well, ſome to <hi>Zante,</hi> others to <hi>Ceffalonia, Corfu</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> landing the <hi>Greeks</hi> as they had a fancy to the place which they came to, or as they found freinds. Thus they left their Eſtates to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and not above 5 or 6 <hi>Greeks</hi> remained, who being in years, and ſickly withal, deſir'd leave of the General, that they might tarry, and end their days there. In the Articles of peace it was concluded, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould keep poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99880:47"/>of three ſmall Iſlets which are cloſe to the Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> and have each a very ſtrong Caſtle. The <hi>Turks</hi> did laugh at their propoſals, ſaying we have the Henn, and the Chicken will follow of courſe, of theſe Iſletts you ſhall have a further account hereafter. This Iſland had 20 Citys, and above 1000 Towns, Villages and large Monaſterys, now there is not above 4 Citys, and 300 Towns and Villages. To give you an account of them I will begin with the eaſtern part. This was formerly a Province called <hi>Sittia;</hi> the head City had the ſame name, ſtanding in a Bay, at the North Eaſt part of the Iſland, at the Weſt ſide extending from the North, to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Bay Southerly, above a mile in length. The Caſtle ſtood on a riſing ground to the N W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of the Town, built of a courſe Marble ſtone. The <hi>Venetians</hi> finding the place was not Tenable, cauſed ſeveral mines to be made, by which they deſtroy'd the Caſtle and Town, and ſo went to <hi>Candia.</hi> By the ruins it may be ſeen the builders had no thoughts, ſo ſoon to have left them; moſt of the Walls are intire and ſome have lower rooms with beams, which are patcht up, and ſerve for ſtore houſes to put corn in, when any ſhip comes to lade. In the year 1680 I was here and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Sattee</hi> of <hi>Provence</hi> Captain <hi>Iſeppe Bremon</hi> who belonged to <hi>Caſſis</hi> about 10 miles from <hi>Marſellis.</hi> The Wheat was the <hi>Baſha</hi>'s own, which he ſold
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99880:47"/>at 3 <hi>Timins</hi> a <hi>Killoe,</hi> (i. e. about <hi>14<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</hi> the Buſhel.) The <hi>Turk</hi> who came with me from <hi>Candia,</hi> was an ordinary Servant. But as we travelled the Road, and when we came hither he would do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer at a ſtrange rate. Here are no Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants nearer then 12 miles, at a ſmall Village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Alona,</hi> ſaving at a ſmall houſe and Chappel, which is a <hi>Metoiki</hi> (or Chappel of eaſe to a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery up in the Mountains) about a quarter of a mile from the Sea. Amongſt others the <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſts brought their tenths, to the <hi>Turks.</hi> They all deſire to have a Seaman to meaſure their Corn rather then the <hi>Turks;</hi> for they will ſtir the corn about with their hands, and preſs it down; But the Maſter was content to take it with a juſt meaſure, and Favoured the poor <hi>Greeks</hi> what he could. At <hi>Alona</hi> reſides the <hi>Baſha</hi>'s Lieutenant, who has 100 <hi>Spahees</hi> to guard the Coaſt from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers; but more to gather in the tenths. The <hi>Greeks</hi> maintaine them, at their own charge. To the Eaſtward of <hi>Sittia</hi> on a point of land, is a Monaſtery dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Iſidoro</hi> to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs a great Revenue, it maintains about 40 <hi>Calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeros.</hi> There are ſeveral rich Lamps, and other ornaments of Silver and Gold. Here they ſhew you the Picture of the Bleſſed Virgin, which (they ſay) was brought by Angels from <hi>Stancoi,</hi> and was found in a cave of that Mountain. They have Lands on the Iſland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99880:48"/>have a <hi>Metoiki</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Calojeroes,</hi> to gather in the cropps of corne, oyl and wine; the <hi>Turks</hi> allowing them to enjoy it, calling it <hi>Vacofa,</hi> or poſſeſſions for Gods uſe, yet they will receive their tenths from it. The <hi>Gomina</hi> or Overſeer of this Monaſtery had made his Eſcape, taking with him above two thouſand pieces of Eight, in ready mony and plate, but being purſued, he was taken at <hi>Scarpante</hi> an Iſland lying in the midd way, between <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> &amp; by the <hi>Baſha</hi>'s order put to death. To the South of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> about 10 miles is a very high Mountain cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>Turks Baſha Dogg,</hi> from it may be ſeen the Sea, to Eaſt, Weſt, North and South. Here are the Ruins of a Caſtle called formerly <hi>Barozza,</hi> 'twas built by a Gentleman of that name. It is, ſquare, about 60 Foot high, with a tarrazzo, and battlements on the top, each ſquare is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40 foot. The Wall is very thick; the door about 10 foot from the ground, having a dry ditch about it. Of theſe there are ſeveral about the Iſland, as the old built Caſtles are in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For formerly the <hi>Candiotes,</hi> did uſe to Warr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, but now all ſuch quarrells are ended by their ſubjection to a common Maſter. The City of <hi>Girapetra</hi> is to the South of the Iſland, having no ſecure Port, but an open Road, where Veſſels in the Summer time may be with ſecurity from the Weather, but not from Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99880:48"/>for while I was there, they carryed away a Saike which came from <hi>Alexandria.</hi> The Town is wall'd round, and hath a ſmall Caſtle which lyes higher then the Town. Here is continually a Garriſon of 200 <hi>Janizaries,</hi> beſides there are ſeveral <hi>Turks,</hi> who are Merchants, ſo that in all they can raiſe 500 fighting men. There is about it a very fine plain full of Olive trees and ſome pleaſant Gardens. Their houſes are well built, of good ſtone, the rooms very lofty; but few houſes above two ſtorie high. In the year 1675, one <hi>Monſieur Crevellier,</hi> a famous Privateer, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 500 men in the Bay of <hi>Spina Longa,</hi> travelling in the night, he came next morning, juſt at the dawning of the day, and found the <hi>Turks</hi> at their <hi>Sabbah namas</hi> morning prayer, ſo he made himſelf maſter of the Town, carryed away 200 ſlaves, nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Guns which were in the Caſtle. The <hi>Turks</hi> which were at the South part of the Town, betook themſelves to ſome ſmall Veſſels, for they had not the heart to return home, to fetch their armes. Monſieur <hi>Crevellier</hi> to retreat with this great prize, reſolved to kill what horſes he found, ſecuring twenty for himſelf, &amp; officers, to ride at the reare; This enter prize was effected in leſs then ſix hours after they enter'd the Town, for they did not tarry to ranſack the houſes much. After they were departed, about 300 men, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> were got together, and marched a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99880:49"/>mile or two out of town, and had not <hi>Crevellier</hi> kill'd the horſes, he could never have got out of the Iſland. It is very ſtrange that ſo many men could come with that ſecreſy as not to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and that the hearts of thoſe <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould be ſo dull'd. Immediatly they diſpatch't expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> Writing to the <hi>Baſha</hi> that above 1500 Chriſtians had landed, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away 200 Priſoners, moſt of them men of the Garriſon; the <hi>Baſha</hi> asked the meſſenger, if the reſt of the Inhabitants were a ſleep, or dead; <hi>No ſays the meſſenger, but their hearts were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſurprized, ſome in their Moſques, and ſome in the Coffee houſes, and not a man, that had his ſenſes. Moſt of the horſes being alſo kill'd.</hi> The <hi>Baſha</hi> aſked him how he eſcaped, he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, <hi>that he had the wit to hide himſelf, as a great many others did.</hi> There were three Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys in the Mole at <hi>Candia,</hi> under the command of one <hi>Babba Haſſan,</hi> who were ſent out to look after <hi>Crevellier,</hi> but to no purpoſe, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without ſeeing him. Since, there is an order that the Gates ſhall be ſhut an hour before Sunn ſet, and not opened till an hour after morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers, and now there are ſeveral guards on the Mountains, beſides the <hi>Baſha</hi> of <hi>Candia,</hi> has threatned, the Providitore at <hi>Spina Longa,</hi> to complain to <hi>Venice</hi> if he ſuffer any Privateers to come into that Bay; ſo as for ſome years they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99880:49"/>have attempted nothing. The Country towards the South is not ſo mountanous as to the North, and Northweſt parts; having ſeveral large and pleaſant plaines, which have many ruins of fine town's. To the Eaſt of <hi>Girapetra</hi> about 10 miles I went to ſee a Cave under the Mountain of <hi>Iro</hi> as they now call it, where they ſay S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> preached: it is a large Chappel having 12 pillars all cut out of the Rock, which was done by the Chriſtians in the night time. Some ſay it was finiſhed in leſs then a months time. Cloſe by is a Fountain where they ſay he uſed to Baptize, and it is now called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pauls</hi> Fountain, the water thereof is very good, to cure ſuch as have ſore eyes. From <hi>Gierapetra</hi> to <hi>Bonifacia</hi> is 14 hours riding moſt in plains, very delightſome, there being very high Mountains to the North, with moſt pleaſant valleys between, and abundance of <hi>Cyprus</hi> trees. <hi>Bonifacia</hi> ſtands on a riſing ground, having only the Walls of a Caſtle. The Inhabitants are moſt <hi>Greeks,</hi> very poor; here is a Metropolitan who pretends to be next to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Candia.</hi> There are two <hi>Italian</hi> Churches; the dores are made up with Walls to keep Cattle from going in. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have four ſmall Churches, but one will contain more then all the Inhabitants. They have now new named the place calling it <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facia</hi> inſtead of <hi>Bonifaci</hi> (good Face) it being ſo much alter'd from what it was in former time.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99880:50"/>From <hi>Bonifacia</hi> to the <hi>Labarinth</hi> is about 10 miles, or three hours riding W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, moſt a plain. Several men have ſeveral opinions about this building, (if I may call it ſo.) But one Signior <hi>Venetando,</hi> who was born in a neighbouring Village, gives this account, that a certain King of this Iſland, had ſo great a hatred for all women, that he order'd this place for his Court, and at laſt lived ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate that he would not ſuffer any to come to him but ſuch as ruled in his ſtead. He would ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come out but to worſhip at a Temple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to Jupiter, which ſtood cloſe by it. In this <hi>Labarinth</hi> he ended his days, and had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Tombe built for him, the ruins of which they ſhew you. The <hi>Labarinth</hi> is above two miles about, being ſo covered on the top with earth, as it ſeems to be all of firm land; we entred it with two torches, and candles in Lanthornes, having a line to direct us out again. The way is plain under foot, and archt over head, ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being about 10 foot high, ſome more, ſome leſs, with ſeveral windings. I made it my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to obſerve if there was any thing of a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the pillars or ſides, but found it moſt an entire ſtone, which they told me, ſo cemented together that indeed it appeared ſo. Here are a great many ſmall places about 4 foot long, 2 broad, and 2 over, which were for burying pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There are abundance of batts, which hang
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99880:50"/>in cluſters, ſome are larger than ordinary. We endeavoured to fright them ſcorching their wings, by which we found there was life in them; their ſleep is obſerv'd to be much more ſound with a N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. wind, than with a S<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. wind, as the ſpring comes on, they leave their palace. We had almoſt end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our line, being about 100 pikes, which is above 80 yards, and then returned out, being a good hour in the <hi>Labarinth.</hi> The damps are very great; againſt rain it is always dropping, but very dry with Northerly winds. At the end is a lake, and they tell you, that ſome have attempted to go to it, and have been drawn into it. Our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity did not invite us to ſee it, for were it not true, as in probability 'tis not, the noiſom ſmells are enough to ſtifle one. To the South and cloſe by, is a ſmall Village with two Churches, which ſeem to have been Temples. To the S W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, about 10 miles diſtant, is that famous and great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called <hi>Pſillo Vuona,</hi> formerly Mount <hi>Ida;</hi> at 4 of the Clock it caſts a ſhadow on the <hi>Labarinth,</hi> on it are many pleaſant Monaſteries with Groves of Cypreſs trees, and abundance of Fountains. Some ſay the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary</hi> may be ſeen from the top. From the <hi>Labarinth</hi> to <hi>Candia</hi> is about 10 hours riding, moſt in a plain, till within 10 miles of the City. At the right hand, about a mile from the road, is a moſt ſtately Monaſtery, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to our bleſſed Saviour, which was built by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99880:51"/>order of the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great. It hath always been continued to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and kept its ſplendor, till the late Warr, when it was much defaced. There are abundance of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterys, but very poor, and ſome are ſhut up for want of Prieſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Candia Novo</hi> is about 6 miles from the City of <hi>Candia</hi> Southward, being a ſtrong Caſtle, having <hi>Mount Jove</hi> to the Weſt. Here the <hi>Turks</hi> kept their Treaſure and Ammunition, in the Siege of <hi>Candia.</hi> It is ſeated very pleaſantly on a riſing ground, giving a proſpect to the Sea. It is now chiefly inhabited by <hi>Greeks;</hi> the Caſtle has a Garriſon of <hi>Turks,</hi> which the <hi>Baſha</hi> intended to bring to <hi>Candia,</hi> and demoliſh the Caſtle, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing writ to the Port about it; but he had no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <hi>Candia,</hi> ſo famous, and generally known for the brave defence it made againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> appears by the ruins to have been one of the beſt built Citys in the midd-land Seas. It is ſeated on the North ſide of the Iſland, almoſt midd-way between <hi>Canea</hi> and <hi>Sittia,</hi> in a pleaſant Bay, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an artificial Port, ſecured from the N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> wind by a Mole about 200 yards long, with a ſtrong and large Caſtle at the head, called <hi>Caſtel del Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> having 20 great Guns. From the South is a low point of land, which runs into the Sea N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. which ſecures it from the Eaſterly wind's, and makes the entrance not above 30 yards wide;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99880:51"/>upon this point of land the <hi>Turks</hi> have built a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd way, with a very thick wall, full of holes, for ſmall ſhot, ſtrongly arch't over, reaching from the Arſenal to the entrance into the Port, where is a ſmall Fort with 4 great Guns, alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrongly arch't over, ſo as no Bomb can offend it. At the right hand, at coming out of the Gate to the Mole, is a new Fort built with 4 very great Guns, which lye level with the water, over them are 8 ſmaller Guns. This Fort is oppoſite to the mouth of the Port, and is arch't over to prevent danger from Bombs, or wild fire. On the Mole, are ſeveral great Guns planted with arches over them. To the Eaſt of the Arſenal, is the old Caſtle called <hi>La Battaria del Arſenal,</hi> which is rebuilt, with a ditch round it, to bring in the Sea, moſt cut out of a firm Rock. The Port is almoſt round, and ſecure againſt any wind, for Gallys and ſmaller Veſſels, but there is not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough for ſhips of any conſiderable bigneſs. It is fill'd very much with the rubbiſh, that the rains carryed into it, from the City, and would certainly have been choakt up in a few years, had it not been for a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, one <hi>Monſieur Dudei,</hi> who, to ingratiate himſelf with the <hi>Baſha,</hi> cauſed an Engine to be brought from <hi>Marſelle</hi> to cleanſe it. There are the ruins of 12 Arches of the Arſenal, and about 6 Arches are yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, but they uſe them only to work in when the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99880:52"/>Gallys are there: No Gallys having been built here. The City is not repair'd towards the land, where the Walls are ſo much ſhaken, that it will require a great deal of time and coſt to fortify them. From the Port towards the Weſt, upon the Wall are 50 large Guns planted. The Fort of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Andrea</hi> at the N. W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of the City is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, having a double wall towards the Sea. In all there are about 400 Guns planted on the Walls, and out-works, which are 6 miles in circumference. The Gates of <hi>Candia</hi> are the beſt I ever ſaw, the Arch or Gate-houſe being about 100 yards long, and the Gates 10 broad, the Arch is all built of firm ſtone. It will take up three hours to walk round the out-works. There are ſeveral mines which were never blown up; Every mine had a diſtinct name, I was in one mine which was above a mile in length, being about 6 foot high and three broad. All the plain for above two miles without the Walls is like a new plow'd field, where you cannot walk, but muſt ſee pieces of dead mens bones. None are permitted to walk round the works, but ſuch as have a Licence and a <hi>Janizary</hi> with them. The <hi>Turks</hi> take a delight to give an account of the ſtrength of the place, and eſpecially will ſhew you a ſmall Cave or arch, where the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral did uſe to ſleep (as they tell you) to ſecure himſelf from the Bombs. Not above one eighth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99880:52"/>part of the houſes, that formerly were, are now inhabited, very few being left entire, nor do the <hi>Turks</hi> repair any but thoſe where they dwell; the chief Moſque is well repair'd, it was formerly a Church dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Mark,</hi> and ſtands to the E<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the great <hi>Piazza;</hi> to the South of it are part of the Walls of old <hi>Candia,</hi> cloſe to which are built up a row of houſes, two ſtorie high for the Janizaries. The <hi>Baſha</hi>'s Pallace is a little below the great Moſque on the other ſide of the way; oppoſite to it is the great Hall, formerly called <hi>La Sala di Conſiglio,</hi> which is a very ſtately building of white Marble, with ſeveral works in <hi>Baſſo Relievo;</hi> to the S E<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. of it ſtands the Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Franciſco</hi> with an entire Cloyſter, which is a Moſque. The ſtreet from the Mole to the chief <hi>Piazza</hi> is in good repair, being broad and pav'd with an even ſtone; the houſes are alſo well inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. But that part towards the W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. is a heap of ruins, amongſt which live the <hi>Jews,</hi> who have very large houſes, but ſome of their upper rooms have no other ſhelter from the weather, but a few matts made faſt upon poles. The beams of the old houſes are bought up, and carryed to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Zante,</hi> and other places; and being made of Cyprus wood they ſerve to make cheſts and cabinets, many of which have been brought to <hi>England.</hi> The number of the Inhabitants of the City is not reckoned to be above 10000 with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99880:53"/>
               <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> There is a continual Garriſon of 2000 Janizaries beſides the <hi>Baſha</hi>'s guardes. Since the taking the place, they have granted liberty to all, who will come to inhabit there, but all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement cannot bring the <hi>Candiotes</hi> to dwell there. Formerly the Plain was full of Olive trees, with delightſom pleaſure-houſes and gardens. Now nothing but ruins are to be ſeen. The City ſtands on a riſing ground from the Sea. The houſes were ſo built with tarrazzis, as moſt from the tops could have a ſight of the Sea. From <hi>Candia</hi> to <hi>Rettimo</hi> is about 12 hours riding. The City ſtands on a point of land very pleaſantly, having a Port to the Eaſt, which is almoſt choakt up, ſo as no Gally can get over the barr being laden, but <hi>Brigantines</hi> and ſmaller Veſſels are very ſecure againſt all winds. Towards the Sea are no Walls, the Rocks there fortifying the place, ſo as an Enemy can only come by land. This place was the firſt the <hi>Turks</hi> made themſelves Maſters of, putting all to the Sword, to give the greater terror to the reſt of the Iſland. Since they poſſeſt it, they have built three new Forts, towards the Sea, and a wall with a dry Ditch to landward. It is now chiefly inhabited by <hi>Turks,</hi> who trade to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> conſiderably. The houſes are here intire according to the <hi>Venetian</hi> manner of building. There are ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> that dwel in the City; but they have a ſmall town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99880:53"/>a quarter of a mile off, where are 2 Churches, where they have free exerciſe of their Religion. The Country hereabout is very pleaſant, full of Olive trees, and from the Sea ſide, the land riſes eaſily to the foot of the Mountains of <hi>Sfacia,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 8 miles from the City, which from the Sea ſeems to be all a wood, from which Mountains run ſeveral pleaſant ſtreames, and one very large river called Platonico, which is continually full, being ſupplyed from above a thouſand Fountains, which the Mountains produce. Theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Sfacia</hi> are abounding in all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for life, and nothing can be more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom in the Summer time. They reach near 30 miles towards the S W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. in length, and in ſome places about 10 in breadth, coming down cloſe to the Bay of <hi>Suda.</hi> The Cheeſe which is made here, is bought up by the <hi>Venetians</hi> and other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and tranſported to <hi>France, Italy, Zante,</hi> &amp;c. It is the beſt Cheeſe that is made in any of the Southern parts, and generally as good as our <hi>Cheſhire</hi> Cheeſes, being made as bigg. Beſides which they have great ſtore of Honey, Wax, Silk, Wool, Cordovan-Leather, and a ſort of goats Hair, little inferior to that of <hi>Angura</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> No Olives, Oranges, or Lemons grow here. There are above 100 Villages on theſe Mountains, beſides ſeveral Monaſteries. The Inhabitants are a Warr-like People, and withſtood
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99880:54"/>the <hi>Turks</hi> above 20 years after <hi>Rettimo</hi> was taken, living as the <hi>Mainiotes</hi> in the <hi>Morea.</hi> There are ſuch difficult paſſages to them, that an army can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not march. Now at laſt they are brought into obedience, and by humbling themſelves to the Vizier, he granted them great privileges, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, leaſt they ſhould take part with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who have the Iſland of <hi>Suda</hi> ſo near them. As the Vizier paſt by in his way from <hi>Canea</hi> to <hi>Candia,</hi> they brought him ſeveral preſents, which the Mountains produced; which he was ſo well pleaſed with, that he exempted them from going with him, and paying their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on him, only he obliged them to furniſh the Camp with mutton at a certain rate. Moſt of his own proviſion was carryed from hence. Sheep at three <hi>timins</hi> (about a ſhilling) a piece, butter at a <hi>timine</hi> the <hi>oke</hi> (a groat for two pound 8 ounces) Cheeſe at the ſame rate, and at this price they were obliged to carry it as far as the Camp before <hi>Candia,</hi> where an officer gave them an acquittance, which was abated them out of their tribute. They have a certain Drugg, called by the <hi>Venetian Oldani,</hi> much of the colour of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh in balls, it is a very great conforter of the head, having a pleaſant ſmell, being burnt it gives a very pleaſant ſent. Moſt of this is bought up by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Venice.</hi> Here is alſo a ſort of wood which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Platte
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99880:54"/>ikſillo,</hi> it burns like a torch &amp; gives a moſt fragrant ſmell; much of it was uſed to burn at the Siege. Every night at the Viziers, and other great mens tents they had fires of this wood, the wood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut ſmall, and put into an Iron grate at the end of a pole faſtned in the ground. If a man be hot in the plain, in riding two or three hours up the hills, he ſhall find ſo great an alteration in the air, as is incredible. About 15 miles from <hi>Retimo</hi> is a lovely Fountain called <hi>Bognare Baſhe,</hi> ſtanding ſo between two mountains, that at 2 in the afternoon it is ſhady, continuing ſo all the reſt of the day. The water is ſo cold as will cauſe a dew upon any fruit that is put into it, and be one never ſo hot, to drink of this water it will do him no harm: In the Summer time here are always ſome perſons of Quality, who bring their beds, and continue for ſeveral days together. The <hi>Sfacioti</hi> are a healthy, ſtrong, and ſtout people, they pretend to be of a very Ancient Stock, ſome there are who derive their family from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of our Saviour. I ſaw a <hi>Callojero</hi> that was 110 years of age, he was very luſty and could walk very well with a ſtaff. Part of theſe hills are under the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Retimo,</hi> and part under that of <hi>Canea.</hi> From <hi>Retimo</hi> to <hi>Canea,</hi> the Road is moſt by the Sea ſide paſſing by the Bay of <hi>Suda,</hi> having the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Sfacia</hi> on the left hand.

               <hi>Canea</hi> is ſeated in a fine plain about 3 miles from the bottom of the Bay of <hi>Suda,</hi> and upon the Sea to the North, having a very fair harbour which may be called a double Port, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round, the other ſtretching away to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; where are two Arſenals. It is ſecure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the worſt of weathers, The entrance is narrow, and not above 18 foot water. To the Weſt of which the <hi>Turks</hi> have built a new batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with 20 very large Guns, and above it to the South is a great Cittadel, in which are 40 good Guns. To the Eaſt of the Entrance is another great Caſtle which commands the part called the <hi>Sabioniera,</hi> with the Arſenal. Round about the Port is a broad key, which is always full with merchandize, and is little inferior to the Port at <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> The houſes are all very well built and not much batter'd. The Walls are in very good repair, having a dry ditch about 30 yards broad, and 6 deep, from the land on the other ſide. The Walls are about 30 foot high; within them the earth is raiſed, about 10 foot higher than the Walls, there being a walk between. There is a mount which they call the <hi>Marteningo</hi> where formerly were 10 Guns, but now it is of no uſe. Toward the land there are 4 Baſtions. To the South is the great gate called <hi>La Porti di Retimo.</hi> To the Weſt is a mace placed on the Wall, to ſhew where a <hi>Baſha,</hi> at the taking of the place,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99880:55"/>firſt enter'd the City: before the Gate is a half moon built of earth about 20 foot high; at each end is a ſmall Pyramid of mortar and ſculls, which are the ſculls of Chriſtians, who were ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the place in the year 1666. The <hi>Venetians</hi> then attempting to regain the place under the conduct of <hi>Marquis Vila,</hi> a Savojard, 5000 men were landed at <hi>Culatte</hi> at the bottom of the Bay of <hi>Suda,</hi> and were encamped before the City ſeveral days. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſallyed out of the City, to the W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. ſurprizing the Chriſtians, and had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great victory, purſuing them to the Fort which was built at the bottom of the Bay. In this flight there were above 1500 killed and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral taken Priſoners: amongſt the latter was one Captain <hi>Scot,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi>-man, who had his hand upon the draw-bridg of the City; he was carryed afterwards to <hi>Smyrna</hi> in the Gally's and there redeem'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants: but when he came to <hi>Venice</hi> his arrears were paid him and he returned his ranſom to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd in bank, till another like occaſion ſhould preſent it ſelf. The City is near three miles in circumference, and is much better Inhabited than <hi>Candia,</hi> having a <hi>Baſha</hi> and other officers as in <hi>Candia,</hi> only in all Councils the other hath the precedence. The Country about is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, being all a plain for above 6 miles to the South and Weſt, planted with young Olive trees
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99880:56"/>ſo that it ſeems to be a Garden. It is well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, both with Fleſh, and Fiſh, of the latter there is great ſtore, for beſides the Sea, there is a Lake about 10 miles to the South, which furniſhes them with great variety of all ſorts. The trade is much greater here than at <hi>Candia,</hi> it lying ſo convenient, for the <hi>Morea, Italy,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The <hi>French</hi> have a great trade for oyl, wools, wax, cheeſe, and ſeveral other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, having a Conſul, and two Merchants. The <hi>Venetians</hi> have alſo a Conſul, but moſt of their oyl is ſhipped off from <hi>Suda,</hi> to which place it is brought from <hi>Retimo</hi> and other places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. All great ſhips come to an anchor at a place called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Todoro,</hi> being 2 ſmall Iſletts about 5 miles to the Weſt of the Port of <hi>Canea;</hi> there is very good anchorage, and a ſmall Fort to defend them. On one Iſland, notwithſtanding it ſeems to be all ſtone, and is very low, there are ſeveral Fountains of water. No <hi>Greeks</hi> live within the City. They have a new town built to the South, about half a mile off, where are two long ſtreets, very commodious, and here they injoy all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they deſire: their Churches are open, and the Biſhop hath a very pleaſant houſe, living in good Eſteem. Cloſe to this town runs a pleaſant River, which is ſeldom dry, There are likewiſe ſeveral pleaſant gardens, well ſtock't with all ſorts of delicious fruits. The <hi>Turks</hi> have alſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99880:56"/>ſome gardens here, but they muſt retire into the City an hour before Sun ſet, winter and ſummer, or elſe muſt remain out all night, the gates being then ſhut, and a ſtrict watch kept about the Walls. The <hi>Turks</hi> of this place are generally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich, and incline to trade, giving all encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have Merchants come and reſide amongſt them. There was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchant here one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Trenchard,</hi> who was recommended to the <hi>French</hi> Conſul to have his aſſiſtance, but in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time he grew weary of the place. Here they keep their oyl in great Veſſels called <hi>Tini,</hi> which are ſquare and made of wood, ſome will hold 20 Tunns. They have a ſpecial regard to preſerve the eſteem of their oyl, nor will they force a merchant to take any longer than it comes clear, not mixing the bottoms, as in ſome parts they will, by taking a hollow cane, and putting it to the bottom, by blowing through which they raiſe the foot of the oyl, ſo that thick and thin goes together. Here they ſell the Foot of the oyl at an under price; and this ſerves to make ſope. Moſt parts of <hi>Turky</hi> have an Eſteem for <hi>Canea</hi> oyl above others. Some will have it to be the better for that the trees are all ſo young; others impute it to their care in the making, for here they gather all their Olives, whereas in the <hi>Morea</hi> they thraſh them down with poles. The wines are generally Eſteem'd above all others. The red muſcadine
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99880:57"/>they call here <hi>Leattico,</hi> 'tis a richer wine than <hi>Tent</hi> at <hi>Cadize,</hi> and much more pleaſant. I have ſeen it ſold at 15 gallons for half a dollar. White muſcadine is not ſo good as that at <hi>Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> in <hi>Ceffalonia.</hi> Some are of opinion that in the Warr the true Muſcadine grape was loſt; on the Mountains there are ſmaller ſorts of Wine, ſo as a man may have what ſort he pleaſes. All ſorts of Proviſion are very plentiful, but in the Summer time the mutton hath generally a bad taſt, which proceeds from their feeding on ſome hearb on the Mountains. Here are Fowl of all ſorts in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance; but eſpecially a bird called <hi>Beccha Figge,</hi> which is almoſt a lump of Fat: they are valued about 4 for an aſper, (or 8 for a penny) Turtle-doves and Quailes are very plentifull. Their Beef is ſmall, but very ſweet. Of Fruits there is no ſort, but what they have. I never ſaw larger pears than are brought from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, being a ſort of Sugar pear. Their muſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melons are very good, but their water-melons are ſingular. Salating there is all the year of all ſorts: no place is eſteem'd to have larger and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Endive and Carduus, than there are here. I have ſeen Sugar canes of a great height, full as good as what are brought from <hi>Grand Cairo.</hi> There are abundance of Simples which are bought here for <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> Some ſay the reaſon why no Venemous thing will live on this Iſland, is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99880:57"/>the quantity of <hi>Dittamo</hi> that grows here. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay it has only been ſince S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> ſet foot upon the Iſland. Moſt of the <hi>Candiotes</hi> pretend to have great knowledg in Simples. The women are experienced Doctoreſſes. One I have reaſon to ſay was very ſkilful, ſhe having in a little time wrought a great cure upon me; For by accident a Bullet having paſt through my Legg, I applyed my ſelf to her, and in 15 days ſhe cured it. She did not allow me to eat any fleſh, till it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well. They have ſeveral antidotes againſt the Plague, but they had not the effect they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, for ſeveral of the Doctoreſſes were ſwept away by that diſeaſe, but moſt certain it is that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> day, it did here abate, as they always obſerve it in moſt of theſe Eaſtern parts. There are ſeveral other places that have had the name of Citys, which are now heaps of ruins; many hundred ſtately Pallaces there were that now have only ſome Walls, and thoſe moſt fallen down. The <hi>Candiots</hi> keep their Habit, that is the women, but the men are moſt <hi>alla Turcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> eſpecially the better ſort. They are as Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Antiquity of their Country, as the <hi>Moreotes,</hi> that have been above 200 years in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. There is no Latin Church upon the whole Iſland (as I was informed) but what is ſhut up, or converted to the <hi>Turks</hi> uſe. Before the <hi>Turks</hi> conquered this Iſland, there were above a million
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99880:58"/>of Souls, whereas now there are not 80000, of which not obove 30000 <hi>Turks</hi> on the whole Iſland.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Spina Longa,</hi> lyes about 40 miles to the Eaſt of the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> at the Entrance of a great Bay. The Iſlett is not above a mile and a half about, it has a very good Fortification round it, beſides 'tis ſteep all about, ſo as an Enemy cannot well land. It is not above a mile from a point of land, where the <hi>Turks</hi> raiſed a Battery, and continued for a week to batter the Caſtle, but to little Purpoſe, for moſt of their dwellings are in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99880:58"/>Caves under ground. Here and at <hi>Carabuſa</hi> is no water but what is brought them by ſhipping. or what they ſave in great Ciſterns and Jarrs. Here is alſo a Proveditore and a Garriſon of <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> ſoldiers.</p>

The Iſland is about 2 miles in circumference, not above 50 foot above the water at the higheſt part, being all rock and ſteep round. To the S W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. lyes a long Rock about 10 foot above water, and not above 20 from the Iſland; againſt it is the Entrance up to the Caſtle very ſteep and winding; having two Gates, and a ſtrong counterſcarp before you paſs into the main Caſtle. The Wall about the Iſland is low but very thick. To the W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. is a Mount called <hi>il Marteningo,</hi> about 30 Foot high, and 300 in circumference very ſtrongly built with ſmall ſtone and mortar, which has above 1000 ſhot in it. They are ſo faſt in, that it would indanger its falling, if they ſhould be pull'd out. The Caſtle is quite round the Iſlett, wherein and upon the <hi>Marteningo</hi> are about 120 Guns planted. The <hi>Turks</hi> have ſeveral times attempted to take this place, and to that purpoſe in the year 1659 they built 6 Caſtles, three on

In the year 1665 the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Baſha</hi> attempted to aſſault it; he came with 45 Gally's, but durſt not adventure to land any men. He cauſed the Gallys to batter that part which is to Sea-ward, while on the other ſide they continually fired from the 6 Forts. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Fleet was ſo diſperſed that they could not come to relieve them.

But it pleaſed God to ſhew them his goodneſs in a ſignal manner, by a ſhot from the Enemy, which did cleave a rock in ſunder at the bottom a little above the Sea, out of which ſprang a water which ſufficed them to drink. I have ſeen the Fountain, and drank of the water, tho it is not very pleaſant. Several Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that were in the Iſland, when it was Beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed avouched this for a truth; It being noted in the <hi>Venetian</hi> Hiſtory of <hi>Suda.</hi> The winds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Northerly the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet came from <hi>Zante,</hi> forcing the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallys to retreat.

When we were got to the height of the Weſtern Iſlands, our Maſter order'd a New main Sail to be brought to yard, which proved too wide by two cloaths; (or breadths of Canvas) ſo it was again taken down, and firſt fair day it was fitted, and brought to the yard. The winds were veerable for ſeveral days, and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we came to the Channel, we found a great head Sea, (i. e. a Sea coming againſt us) which made us fear we ſhould find Eaſterly winds. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> we judged our ſelves to be about 100 Leagues to the Weſtward of the lands-end. The wind came up at Eaſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for two days very ſtormy, ſo as we could not carry any ſail abroad but were drove to and fro', at the mercy of the ſea, whoſe waves were grown to that height, that we feared we ſhould have been ſwallowed up in them. The 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the wind abated, we ſaw a ſhip which was to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of us, and made ſigns to ſpeak to us, ſo we boare up, and coming to Lee-ward of them, found it was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhip called the Preſident, which came from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and had been beating (i. e. ſtriving againſt the wind) above 6 weeks in the Channel. We came ſo near as we durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99880:61"/>when they begged of us for Gods ſake to ſpare them ſome proviſion for they were ready to periſh: And notwithſtanding the ſeas run ſo high yet did they adventure to hoiſe out their Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace with which 8 men came aboard our ſhip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to us the miſerable condition which they were in, being 80 perſons aboard, who for a months time had lived on a pound of bread for a week, and a pint of water a day each man; moſt humbly did they begg that we would ſpare them ſome proviſion, otherwiſe they muſt of neceſſity periſh. So our Maſter gave them about 100 <hi>l</hi> of bread, a Barrel of Bear, and promiſed them, that he would not go from them, but if the weather were moderate he would ſupply them next day with what he could well ſpare. All that night the wind encreaſed, as next morning both the Preſident and we were forced to hand all our ſails and hull (lye with our head to the wind without any ſaile.) The 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> we loſt ſight of the Preſident, and the ſtorme increaſed ſtill more and more. The 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> about 4 of the clock in the afternoon, a ſea broak upon our ſhip, which carryed away the waſts of the ſhip (i. e. that part of the ſides above the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per deck) even with the upper deck, from the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deck to the fore Caſtle; the Boate, Capſtern, Windeſs and Sheat-anchor were waſht away, my Cheſt was faſt at the one ſide of the Cabin door, &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Robert Johnſons</hi> at the other, were both waſht
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99880:61"/>away. The Maſter immediatly ordered the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zane-maſt to be cut down, the better to keep the ſhip before the wind; the ſea had a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the hold between the Timber heads (i. e. topps of the ribbs of the ſhip,) to ſtop which we imployed our blankets and ruggs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to pump, with both pumps, and all little enough to keep our ſhip above water; none in the ſhip but were wet, and waſhed ſeveral times by the ſea. Never was a longer night ſeen to any of us, and the whole night we were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep the pumps going, fearing all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would prove vain. About 4 in the morning one of our Pumps did ſuck, which was the moſt comfortable news we could then expect, but yet we were not free from fears leaſt the Seas ſhould waſh away thoſe ruggs which we had ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in between the timbers. Sleep was quite ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh't from our eyes all that night, and when the morning appeared (which was welcomed with our great thanks to Almighty God for the ſight of another day) we endeavoured to make a ſtronger reſiſtance againſt the ſeas, finding that the continual working of the ſea had almoſt waſht away our ruggs, and what means to uſe, our confuſed thoughts knew not. But God put into our Maſters mind the two peices of Canvas which our main-ſaile was over charged with, which he order'd to be brought up, and when we had well
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99880:62"/>forc't in the blankets and ruggs, then we ſpread the Canvas over it, nailing it down with pieces of hoops at each ſide; all the time the ſea waſhed the men who were made faſt with ropes, and by this means (Bleſſed be God) we kept our ſhip free with one Pump continually going. The fury of this ſtorm continued three days, and three nights driving us above 200 leagues back again. <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. the wind abated and veer'd about to the North-Weſt, but the ſea continued high from the Eaſtward, ſo as we were fain to keep an eaſy ſaile, not to force the ſhip into a head ſea. <hi>February</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the wind increaſed at W N W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. all night. We having only our two Courſes abroad. Towards break of day, we handed our main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but before it was well ſecured the ſtorm came ſo violently upon us, that the Maſter order'd the fore-yard likewiſe to be lower'd, but all their ſtrength could not get it down, nor was there any of the men that had a knife (having only their drawers without pockets) to cut the ſaile (which they would have done) ſo as it forc't the head of the ſhip into the ſea, and ſtopt her way as a great ſea poop't us (that is it broke over our Stern) and fill'd us, as we all expected immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to go down to the bottom, nothing but the Maſts and fore-Caſtle were above water, the Maſter ſtood by the remaining part of the Mizan-maſt, faſtned to it with a rope, nothing
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99880:62"/>but his head was above water; and for a ſmall time the ſhip remained without any motion, but God of his infinite goodneſs was pleaſed again to draw us from the Deep. Our ſhip with another Sea was lifted up, and our fore-ſaile was got down and ſtowed. We were forced to bore holes between decks to let the water into Hold, and could not Pump out in ſix hours time the water we received with that ſea. We continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaile all that day, and the wind continu'd fair. The 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. the wind abated, and the ſeas were more moderate; ſo we hoiſed our Main-ſaile, with which and our fore-ſaile, (both reeft) we ſtood in for the Channel, about noon we ſaw a ſaile having but one maſt, judged it to be a Ketch, but drawing nearer found it was a ſhip in diſtreſs, having loſt her main and mizane maſts, ſeveral Guns were fierd to give us notice of their great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſo we looſed the reef (holes made to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the ſaile in ſtormy weather) of our main-ſaile, ſteering directly towards them. About three of the clock in the afternoon we came up with the ſhip, and coming under their Stern, the Maſter with the reſt of the men got up, upon the quarter deck, upon their knees, with ſtretched-out arms, bare heads and a dolefull voice, cryed out to us to ſave them for the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> ſake, for that their ſhip had ſix foot water in Hold, and could not be longer kept above water. What heart
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99880:63"/>but muſt relent at ſuch lamentable cryes, &amp; who could paſs by, without doing them all poſſible. good! We promiſed them to take them all in, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireing them to bring what proviſſion they could well ſave. They had but one Boat which was but ſmall, and could not bring them all together, ſo they reſolved to come away as many as could, and thoſe who remained aboard, were to get proviſion ready to bring with them. The men promiſſing the Captain to return with the boat and fetch their Companions, which without their promiſe he would not have come out of the ſhip, and without him they queſtion'd if they ſhould be received by us. The Maſter with 12 more (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many as could be in the Boat) came off, the ſeas run ſo very high, as we thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Boat could ever get aboard us, 4 men rowed and the reſt with hats and caps, hoave the water out of the boat, &amp; ſo ſoon as they came to our ſhip ſide, every one greedy to get in, let the boat knock againſt our ſhip ſide, ſo as her leaks increaſed, and ſoon filled with water that none of the men would adventure to return for their companions, but ſuffer'd the boat to go a drift, which ſo much greived the Maſter and us all as was unexpreſſible, he having nothing but a cap on his head made of a Napkin, not ſo much as his Journal or any other book, ordering the Boatſwain to bring them with him. But there was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99880:63"/>no recovering the boat, and night coming on, we came ſo near as we could to the ſhip, calling to the men to make a raft with boards, and keep a broad a light, ſo as next morning we might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get them aboard; but ſo ſoon as they perceived the boat was gone, and no hopes of keeping the ſhip above water, they gave us a ſad cry, which pierced the very hearts of us all; but all our endeavours could not availe to help them. We lay by them to wind-ward, they putting a broad a light, but in 3 hours after their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had gotten aboard our ſhip, (being about eight at night) their ſhip ſunk, in which 5 men were loſt. The ſhip was called the <hi>Green Friggat</hi> Captain <hi>John Sugars</hi> Commander, who came from <hi>Virginia,</hi> wanting 7 weeks, and from that Coaſt ſaw no other Veſſel but ours. They had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad weather all the way, loſt their main-maſt and mizan-maſt, in the ſame ſtorm in which we loſt the Waſts of our ſhip; they had caſt over board a great part of their goods, that were ſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between decks, two Pumps were continually imployed, and the water ſo increaſed upon them, that they deſpaired of all hopes. One of the men being on the ſtump of the main-maſt to faſten a rope to get out more goods, he ſaw our ſhip, which ſo rejoyced them, that immediatly they put out their Colours firing ſeveral Guns to give us notice of their condition. The Commander
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99880:64"/>had all his Eſtate in the ſhip, nothing was Inſured, and he ſaved nothing but his life. Now we were to conſider how we ſhould maintain ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of mouths, without any ſupply of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But God Almighty the only Preſerver of all things, did provide for us. We had about a quarter of a pound of bread a day, meat twice a week, and a point of water a day for a man. The Sea-men were allowed ſomething more then the Paſſengers by reaſon of their continual labour. And as our Proviſion was ſhort, ſo was our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites abated. The Sea-men whom we ſaved, aſſiſted at the Pumps eaſing us Paſſengers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. We reckoned our ſelves about 80 Leagues from the lands end, when we took up Captain <hi>Sugars</hi> and his men. The 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>February</hi> we Sounded and found about 60 fathom water, and having the wind at S<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. we ſtood in for the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, at night we Sounded again, and found we were ſhot within <hi>Silly</hi> at the Entrance of <hi>Briſtol</hi> Channel. At day break we ſaw the land on our Starboard-ſide, which confirmed to us where we were; The wind increaſed ſo as we could not maintain any other ſaile abroad but our Courſes, with which we ſtood off from the ſhoar. About noon the wind veered to the W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. blowing ſo hard that we were forced to hand our Courſes (low ſailes) and drive with the Sea, every ſea waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over us. It pleaſed God about midd-night
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99880:64"/>the wind came to the N W<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. ſo as we lay our head towards <hi>Silly,</hi> and next morning found the Iſland on our Lee, ſo made ſaile with our fore-ſaile, and paſt between <hi>Silly,</hi> and the main, and after all our great daingers (Bleſſed be God) the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>February</hi> we got ſafe into <hi>Plymouth</hi> Sound, and immediatly all the Paſſengers got ashoar where (upon our bended knees) we acknowledged the great deliverance which we received. Here we had the news that the <hi>Preſident</hi> we mentioned, which we met and relieved at ſea, was forc't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoar (in the Storm we were in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.) in <hi>Mounts-Bay,</hi> and of 80 perſons only 2 ſav'd, they were ſo weak for want of proviſion as they could not hand their Saile. The woman with Child hired a horſe with a paire of panniers, in each she put a Child, her ſelf riding between them, and got ſafe to <hi>London,</hi> where in leſs then a Week she was delivered of a Boy. What is remarkable more, is, to conſider the great cold which was this year over all theſe Seas, and the many Shipwrecks which happened. The ſea had a continual paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage over us, ſo as our Deck was covered with a green. Many a time and hour, have I ſtood pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with nothing but a Coat, over my Shirt, and a pair of drawers, that the Seas have washed me to the Waſt, ſo was it with the reſt of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who were able to pump, and not one who was troubled with cough or cold, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaning
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99880:65"/>we were ſeveral times wet in the places, where we ſlept: Oh what tongue can expreſs the loving kindneſs, and the tender Mercys of our Good God to the Children of men: Therefore to him alone, from whom alone cometh all our help and comfort, be aſcribed all Honour and Glory World without end, <hi>Amen.</hi>
